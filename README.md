## 🎬 HOW TO ADD YOUR VIDEO

1. Export your nightclub video as `.mp4` (H.264) and optionally `.webm`
2. Place the files in `assets/video/`
3. Name them: `hero-bg.mp4` and `hero-bg.webm`
4. The video will automatically play muted, looped, and fullscreen in the hero
5. Recommended: 10–30 seconds, dark atmosphere, 1080p or 4K

**If you want to use a different filename**, edit `index.html` around line 120:
```html
<source src="assets/video/YOUR-FILENAME.mp4" type="video/mp4">
```

## 🖼️ HOW TO ADD IMAGES

Copy your venue photos into `assets/images/` with the filenames listed above.

**To use your own filenames**, find and replace in `index.html`:
```html
<img src="assets/images/gallery-1.jpg" ...>
<!-- Change to: -->
<img src="assets/images/MY-PHOTO.jpg" ...>
```
